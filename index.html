        Over the past few years, we have given away over 15,000 trees, shrubs,
        and other native plants. Last year in Bloomington alone, we gave away
        and helped plant 1,500 trees in the Waterman, Maple Heights, Trailview,
        and Crestmont neighborhoods. In 2023, we’re continuing the project with
        a lineup of native, edible fruit and nut trees, including pecan,
        persimmon, hazelnut, elderberry, black cherry, aronia- and more. We're
        also planning to have another seedling and garden supply swap on our
        tree distribution day in Bloomington.
